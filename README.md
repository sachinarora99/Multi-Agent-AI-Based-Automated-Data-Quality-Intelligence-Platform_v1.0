# Data Quality Intelligence Platform

A multi-agent AI system that analyses CSV and Excel datasets, detects data quality issues, scores your data, and helps you clean it — all through a simple web interface.


---

## What it does

Upload any CSV or Excel file and the system will:

- Detect missing values, duplicate rows, invalid emails, invalid phone numbers, impossible values (like age = 9999), and statistical outliers
- Give your dataset a quality score from 0 to 100 with a grade (A / B / C / D)
- Show AI-generated recommendations explaining what should be fixed and why
- Let you choose which cleaning actions to apply (Human-in-the-Loop design)
- Clean the data and show a before vs after comparison report
- Save every job to a local database so you can access past analyses anytime

## Quality score formula

| Dimension | Weight | Formula |
|---|---|---|
| Completeness | 30% | 1 - null rate |
| Uniqueness | 25% | 1 - duplicate ratio |
| Validity | 25% | 1 - invalid format ratio |
| Consistency | 10% | Penalises high-null columns |
| Accuracy | 10% | 1 - outlier ratio |

---

## Issues detected

| Issue | How detected |
|---|---|
| Missing values | Null count per column |
| Duplicates | Row comparison ignoring ID columns |
| Invalid emails | Regex pattern matching |
| Invalid phones | Pattern match on phone/mobile columns |
| Impossible values | Domain rules: age (0-120), score (0-100), etc. |
| Statistical outliers | IQR method |
| Constant columns | Columns with only one unique value |

## How to run

**Step 1 — Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 2 — Start the backend**

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Keep this terminal open.

**Step 3 — Open the frontend**

Double-click index.html to open it in your browser.

**Step 4 — Upload a dataset**

Drag and drop any CSV or Excel file.

## Optional — AI with Ollama (free, local)

By default the system uses smart rule-based recommendations.
For full AI analysis install Ollama from ollama.com then run:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Keep Ollama running in the background. The system detects it automatically.

## Sample datasets

Three messy datasets included under sample_datasets/ for testing:

- employees_messy.csv — 40 rows, age = 999 and -5, duplicate employees, invalid emails
- sales_orders_messy.csv — 30 rows, negative quantity, total = 9999999, duplicate orders
- students_messy.csv — 35 rows, score = -5, age = 500, invalid emails, missing values

## Future improvements

- PDF report export
- Support for JSON and TSV formats
- User authentication
- Cloud deployment
- More cleaning strategies
